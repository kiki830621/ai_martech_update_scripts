# Rule Extraction from MP02 (Structural Blueprint)

**Date**: 2025-04-02  
**Author**: Claude  
**Subject**: Extraction of specific rule sections from MP02 into separate rule documents  

## Overview

This record documents the extraction of specific rule sections from the MP02 (Structural Blueprint) meta-principle into dedicated rule documents. This extraction is part of the ongoing implementation of the MP/P/R principle coding system and aims to improve the organization, clarity, and maintainability of the system's structural rules.

## Extracted Rules

Three key rule sections were extracted from MP02 and developed into comprehensive rule documents:

1. **R01_directory_structure.md**
   - Contains detailed rules for directory organization
   - Specifies directory hierarchy, naming, and purpose
   - Includes maintenance guidelines and implementation examples

2. **R02_file_naming_convention.md**
   - Details standardized naming patterns for all file types
   - Covers function libraries, execution scripts, Shiny components, and principles
   - Includes rules for parameters, variables, and constants
   - Provides implementation examples and refactoring guidelines

3. **R03_principle_documentation.md**
   - Defines YAML front matter requirements
   - Establishes document structure requirements
   - Provides content guidelines specific to each principle type
   - Includes maintenance procedures and relationship consistency rules

## Changes to MP02

MP02 (Structural Blueprint) was updated to:
- Remove the detailed rule sections that were extracted
- Add references to the new rule documents
- Maintain overview information about the rules
- Update the influences list to correctly reference the new rule documents

## Benefits

This extraction provides several benefits:
1. **Improved Focus**: MP02 can now focus on its meta-principle role without being diluted by detailed rules
2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Rules can be updated independently as needed
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between meta-principles and their implementing rules
4. **Improved Discoverability**: Rules are now easier to find and reference
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each rule now has expanded detail and examples

## Relationship to the MP/P/R System

This extraction further implements the three-level conceptual framework:
- **Meta-Principles (MP)**: MP02 now more clearly serves its role as a foundational concept
- **Rules (R)**: The three new rule documents provide specific implementation details

## Next Steps

1. Update any references to these rules in other principle documents
2. Review other meta-principles for potential rule extraction
3. Consider if additional rules should be derived from MP02 or other principles
