## Author: Claude
## Topic: Defining Pseudocode Conventions and Documentation Language Preferences

## Summary

This record documents the creation of two new meta-principles: MP22 (Pseudocode Conventions) and MP23 (Documentation Language Preferences). These meta-principles establish a comprehensive framework for expressing different types of content in their most appropriate formal languages, with a particular focus on standardizing pseudocode as a distinct formal language for algorithmic expression.

## Key Elements Implemented

1. **Pseudocode Conventions (MP22)**:
   - Established standardized syntax for pseudocode
   - Defined control structures, data structures, and function definitions
   - Created specialized extensions for data processing, machine learning, and UI workflows
   - Provided comprehensive examples of pseudocode usage

2. **Documentation Language Preferences (MP23)**:
   - Mapped content types to their preferred formal languages
   - Established guidelines for supplementary language usage
   - Defined language preferences for meta-principles, principles, and rules
   - Provided examples of multi-language documentation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pseudocode Conventions (MP22)

MP22 establishes pseudocode as a structured, language-agnostic syntax for expressing algorithms and procedures:

1. **Basic Syntax**:
   ```
   ALGORITHM AlgorithmName(parameters)
       # Description
       statements
       RETURN result
   END ALGORITHM
   ```

2. **Control Structures**:
   ```
   IF condition THEN
       statements
   ELSE
       statements
   END IF
   
   FOR variable FROM start TO end
       statements
   END FOR
   
   WHILE condition
       statements
   END WHILE
   ```

3. **Data Structures**:
   ```
   LET array = [value1, value2, ...]
   LET dict = {key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}
   LET set = {value1, value2, ...}
   ```

4. **Function and Class Definitions**:
   ```
   FUNCTION FunctionName(parameters)
       statements
       RETURN result
   END FUNCTION
   
   CLASS ClassName
       PROPERTY property = default_value
       
       METHOD MethodName(parameters)
           statements
           RETURN result
       END METHOD
   END CLASS
   ```

5. **Domain-Specific Extensions**:
   - Data processing: `LOAD_DATA`, `TRANSFORM`, `FILTER`, `JOIN`
   - Machine learning: `TRAIN`, `EVALUATE`, `PREDICT`
   - UI workflows: `DISPLAY`, `GET_INPUT`, `NAVIGATE_TO`

### 2. Documentation Language Preferences (MP23)

MP23 establishes which formal language is most appropriate for different types of content:

1. **Primary Language Mappings**:
   - Terminological Definitions: Logical Formulation (MP21)
   - Algorithms and Procedures: Pseudocode (MP22)
   - System Architecture: Visual Representation
   - Mathematical Models: Mathematical Notation
   - User Interfaces: Visual Representation
   - Component Interfaces: Code Implementation
   - Business Rules: Logical Formulation (MP21)
   - Data Schemas: Code Implementation

2. **Meta-Principle Documentation**:
   - Meta-Principles (MP): Natural Language primary, Logical Formulation supplementary
   - Principles (P): Natural Language primary, Visual supplementary
   - Rules (R): Natural Language with Pseudocode primary, Code Implementation supplementary

3. **Supplementary Language Usage**:
   - When to add: Complex concepts, diverse audiences, critical components
   - Priority order: Natural Language, Primary of related content, Specific needs
   - Integration approach: Cross-references, consistency, complementary focus

4. **Examples**:
   - Component documentation using pseudocode, visual representation, and code
   - Business rule documentation using logical formulation, natural language, and pseudocode

## Examples from Implementation

### Example 1: Hybrid Sidebar in Pseudocode

```
PROCEDURE RenderHybridSidebar(id, active_module, data_source)
    # Get defaults for fallback values
    LET defaults = GetSidebarDefaults()
    
    # Global controls section
    DISPLAY(Section("Global Controls"))
    
    # Distribution channel selection
    LET channels = data_source.GetChannels() OR defaults.channels
    DISPLAY(RadioButtons(
        id: id + "_distribution_channel",
        label: "行銷通路",
        choices: channels,
        selected: channels[0]
    ))
    
    # Module-specific controls
    DISPLAY(Section("Module-Specific Controls"))
    
    # Render controls based on active module
    IF active_module == "micro" THEN
        RenderMicroControls(id, data_source)
    ELSE IF active_module == "macro" THEN
        RenderMacroControls(id, data_source)
    ELSE IF active_module == "target" THEN
        RenderTargetControls(id, data_source)
    END IF
END PROCEDURE
```

### Example 2: Premium Customer Access in Multiple Languages

**Logical Formulation (Primary)**:
```
∀customer ∈ Customers, 
  (lifetime_value(customer) > PREMIUM_THRESHOLD) → 
  (access_level(customer) = "premium")

∀customer ∈ Customers,
  (access_level(customer) = "premium") →
  (can_access(customer, "premium_reports") ∧
   can_access(customer, "priority_support"))
```

**Pseudocode (Supplementary)**:
```
FUNCTION DetermineAccessLevel(customer)
    IF customer.lifetime_value > PREMIUM_THRESHOLD THEN
        RETURN "premium"
    ELSE
        RETURN "basic"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

## Relationship to Existing Principles

These new meta-principles relate to existing principles in several ways:

1. **MP20 (Principle Language Versions)**:
   - MP22 establishes pseudocode as another language option mentioned in MP20
   - MP23 extends MP20 by mapping content types to preferred languages

2. **MP21 (Formal Logic Language)**:
   - MP22 complements MP21 by providing procedural expression vs. logical formulation
   - MP23 specifies when to use MP21's logical formulation as the primary language

3. **MP00 (Axiomatization System)**:
   - Both MP22 and MP23 extend the axiomatization system with more precise expression tools
   - They add structure to how different aspects of the system are formally documented

4. **P10 (Documentation Update Principle)**:
   - MP23 provides guidance on which languages to use when updating documentation
   - MP22 standardizes pseudocode for algorithmic documentation updates

## Benefits

The implementation of these meta-principles provides numerous benefits:

1. **Standardized Expression**: Creates consistent standards for expressing algorithms and procedures

2. **Appropriate Formalism**: Ensures that each type of content is expressed in its most suitable language

3. **Enhanced Communication**: Improves communication through clearer, more precise expression

4. **Implementation Guidance**: Provides clearer guidance for implementers through standardized pseudocode

5. **Documentation Quality**: Enhances overall documentation quality through appropriate formalism selection

6. **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitates knowledge transfer by matching content with optimal expression forms

7. **Cross-Disciplinary Clarity**: Makes technical concepts more accessible to diverse stakeholders

## Future Applications

Based on these new meta-principles, several future applications emerge:

1. **Pseudocode Templates**: Create standard pseudocode templates for common algorithm types

2. **Multi-Language Documentation Tool**: Develop a tool that supports creating and maintaining multi-language documentation

3. **Converting Existing Documentation**: Apply these standards to convert existing documentation

4. **Documentation Quality Metrics**: Develop metrics to assess adherence to language preferences

5. **Training Materials**: Create training materials on effective pseudocode writing and language selection

## Conclusion

MP22 (Pseudocode Conventions) and MP23 (Documentation Language Preferences) significantly enhance our axiomatization system by standardizing pseudocode syntax and establishing which formal languages are most appropriate for different types of content. These meta-principles ensure that each aspect of the system is expressed in its most suitable formalism, improving clarity, precision, and utility across all documentation.

By providing clear guidelines for language selection and standardized conventions for pseudocode, these meta-principles support more effective communication, better knowledge transfer, and higher-quality documentation throughout the precision marketing system.
