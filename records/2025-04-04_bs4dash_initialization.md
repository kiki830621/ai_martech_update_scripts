# BS4Dash Integration into Initialization Script

## Overview
Added the BS4Dash package to the application's initialization script to ensure consistent UI framework usage following the principle language conventions.

## Motivation
Following principles R10 (Package Consistency Naming) and R13 (Initialization Sourcing), all required packages should be loaded in the initialization script rather than individual app files. The BS4Dash package was previously being loaded directly in app_bs4dash_prototype.R, violating these principles.

## Changes Made
1. Created a patch script (bs4dash_init_patch.R) to add the BS4Dash package to sc_initialization_app_mode.R
2. Updated app_bs4dash_prototype.R to remove redundant package loading code
3. Maintained conditional loading to ensure backward compatibility

## Implementation Details
The BS4Dash package was added to the Shiny-related packages section of the initialization script with proper documentation:

```r
library2("bs4Dash")     # BS4 Dashboard UI components
```

## Expected Impact
- Improved consistency in package loading across the application
- Better adherence to established principles
- Reduced risk of package version conflicts
- Cleaner application code with dependencies centralized

## Next Steps
1. Consider standardizing other UI component libraries in the initialization script
2. Review other application files for similar principle violations
3. Update documentation to reflect BS4Dash as a supported UI framework
