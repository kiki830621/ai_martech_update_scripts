# R05_renaming_methods.md Implementation Record

## Date: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This document records the implementation of the R05_renaming_methods.md principles to resolve duplicate identifiers and complete the renumbering of files in the 00_principles directory.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Principle Files
- P04: P04_app_construction_principles.md and P04_script_separation.md
- P05: P05_data_integrity.md and P05_naming_principles.md
- P06: P06_debug_principles.md and P06_data_visualization.md (after moving P09_data_visualization.md to P06)
- P09: P09_authentic_context_testing.md and P09_data_visualization.md

### 2. Original Files Not Removed
Several original files still existed alongside their renamed versions:
- MP18, MP19, MP22, MP23, MP28, MP29 (should be only MP03-MP08)
- P03, P16, P24, P25 (should be only P00-P09)
- R26, R27 (should be only R00-R05)

### 3. README_RENUMBERED.md vs README.md
Two README files existed, with README_RENUMBERED.md containing the updated information.

## Implementation Process

Following the procedures detailed in R05_renaming_methods.md, we systematically addressed each issue:

### 1. Verification Before Renaming
- Used R05's recursive verification methods to identify all duplicate identifiers
- Confirmed that P04, P05, P06, and P09 had duplicate files
- Analyzed the content of each duplicate to determine which should be kept

### 2. Conflict Resolution

#### P04 Duplicates (P04_app_construction_principles.md and P04_script_separation.md)
- Retained P04_app_construction_principles.md as the canonical P04
- Removed P04_script_separation.md (redundant since P01_script_separation.md exists with the same content)

#### P05 Duplicates (P05_data_integrity.md and P05_naming_principles.md)
- Retained P05_naming_principles.md as the canonical P05
- Removed P05_data_integrity.md (redundant since P02_data_integrity.md exists with the same content)

#### P09 Duplicates (P09_authentic_context_testing.md and P09_data_visualization.md)
- Retained P09_authentic_context_testing.md as the canonical P09
- Moved P09_data_visualization.md to P06_data_visualization.md
- Updated YAML front matter in P06_data_visualization.md to reflect its new ID and relations

#### P06 Duplicates (P06_debug_principles.md and P06_data_visualization.md)
- After moving P09_data_visualization.md to P06, we had a new conflict
- Verified that P03_debug_principles.md already existed with the correct filename
- Updated YAML front matter in P03_debug_principles.md to reflect its correct ID (from P06 to P03)
- Updated relationship references in P03_debug_principles.md

### 3. Reference Consistency Updates
- Updated all references in P06_data_visualization.md from P16 to P07
- Updated all references in P03_debug_principles.md from P05 to P02 and P16 to P07

### 4. Removal of Original Files
- Removed all original files that had been properly renamed:
  - MP18, MP19, MP22, MP23, MP28, MP29
  - P03, P16, P24, P25
  - R26, R27

### 5. README Update
- Retained the content of README.md which already contained the updates from README_RENUMBERED.md
- Removed README_RENUMBERED.md as it was no longer needed

## Final Verification

After completing all renaming operations, we performed a final recursive verification:

1. **Duplicate Check**: No duplicate identifiers were found for MP, P, or R prefixes
2. **File Consistency**: All files follow the correct numbering scheme
3. **Reference Updates**: All internal references were properly updated to match the new numbering

## Conclusion

The implementation of R05_renaming_methods.md has successfully resolved all duplicate identifiers and completed the renumbering of files in the 00_principles directory. The principles now follow a consistent, sequential numbering scheme with no gaps or duplicates, and all references between principles have been updated to maintain consistency.

This exemplifies the value of systematic renaming methods as outlined in R05, which helped identify and resolve naming conflicts while maintaining system integrity and reference consistency.
