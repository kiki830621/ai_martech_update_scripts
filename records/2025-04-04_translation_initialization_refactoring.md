# Translation Initialization Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored the translation dictionary loading and locale handling to follow R34_ui_text_standardization and R36_available_locales rules, centralizing the implementation in fn_load_app_config.R.

## Motivation
The application had duplicate translation dictionary loading code in multiple files (app_bs4dash_prototype.R and fn_load_app_config.R). This violates several principles:
- R13_initialization_sourcing: All initialization should be in the designated initialization files
- R34_ui_text_standardization: Consistent translation function implementation
- R36_available_locales: Proper locale handling and verification
- MP18_dont_repeat_yourself: Avoid duplicating the same functionality in multiple places

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced fn_load_app_config.R with:
   - Improved locale support for en_US.UTF-8 and zh_TW.UTF-8
   - Enhanced translation dictionary lookup with multi-tier matching
   - Added robust error handling and reporting
   - Implemented locale availability checking per R36
   - Added sample translation debugging
   - Removed NA values from dictionaries
   - Added support for pre-loaded config to avoid duplicate loading

2. Updated app_bs4dash_prototype.R:
   - Removed duplicate translation loading code
   - Added diagnostic messages for translation status
   - Maintained fallback function for robustness
   - **Fixed initialization sequence to load YAML config before initialization**
   - Passes pre-loaded config to initialization script

3. Updated sc_initialization_app_mode.R:
   - Added support to detect and use pre-loaded config
   - Maintained backward compatibility

4. Created patch scripts:
   - app_bs4dash_patch.R: Removes duplicate translation code
   - translation_init_patch.R: Updates initialization with locale check

## Implementation Details
- Enhanced translation function with case-insensitive matching
- Added tracking of missing translations to improve dictionary coverage
- Implemented multi-tier locale matching (direct, language code, fallback)
- Added system locale verification with appropriate warnings
- Centralized all translation logic in fn_load_app_config.R

## Expected Impact
- More consistent translation behavior across all applications
- Better locale support following R36_available_locales rule
- Simplified application code by removing duplicate functionality
- Improved error handling and debugging for translation issues
- Better maintainability by centralizing translation logic

## Next Steps
1. Update other application files to use the centralized translation
2. Consider expanding the locale check to verify all required locales
3. Add a validation step to ensure dictionary completeness
4. Create a more detailed report of missing translations
