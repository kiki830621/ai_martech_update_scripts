# Terminology Axiomatization Principle Implementation

**Date**: 2025-04-02  
**Author**: Claude  
**Purpose**: To clarify key terminology and establish formal definitions for concepts used throughout the system

## Overview

During the implementation of the YAML Configuration Principle, we encountered confusion around the terms "source" and "data_source". This highlighted the need for a formal definition of key terminology used throughout the application to ensure consistent understanding and implementation.

## Actions Taken

1. Created the Terminology Axiomatization Principle (29_terminology_axiomatization.md) that:
   - Defines key terms including Source, Data Source, Raw Data, Processed Data, etc.
   - Establishes relationships between terms as formal axioms
   - Differentiates between "Source" (origin platform like Amazon) and "Data Source" (processed data for components)
   - Provides implementation examples for how these terms are used in code and configuration

2. Clarified that:
   - "Source" refers to the origin platform or channel from which raw data is collected (as defined in source.xlsx)
   - "Data Source" refers to the processed, accessible data used by application components

3. Established best practices for terminology usage, including:
   - Explicit term usage
   - Consistent naming patterns
   - Documentation requirements
   - Cross-referencing relationships

## Rationale

The precision marketing system uses various terms that can be ambiguous without formal definitions. For example, the terms "source" and "data_source" could be interpreted in multiple ways. By axiomatizing these terms, we ensure that all team members have a shared understanding of key concepts, reducing misinterpretation and implementation errors.

This principle supports other principles by providing clear definitions for terms used throughout the documentation. It particularly complements the Data Source Hierarchy Principle and YAML Configuration Principle by clarifying the terminology used in those contexts.

## Impact

This principle will help:
- Reduce ambiguity in discussions about system design
- Improve documentation clarity
- Facilitate faster onboarding of new team members
- Ensure consistent implementation across different parts of the system
- Prevent terminology drift over time

## Next Steps

1. Review existing documentation to ensure terminology aligns with the newly established definitions
2. Update the README.md in the principles directory to include this new meta-principle
3. Consider creating a glossary section for quick reference of defined terms
