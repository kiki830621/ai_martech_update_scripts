# Bottom-Up Construction Reclassification

**Date**: 2025-04-02  
**Author**: Claude  
**Task**: Reclassify R16 to P16 and update naming

## Summary

This document records the reclassification of the Bottom-Up Construction guide from a Rule (R) to a Principle (P). The document was previously classified as R16_bottom_up_construction_guide.md but has been determined to be a broader, more conceptual principle rather than a specific implementation rule. Additionally, the naming has been updated to follow the domain-specific naming convention for principles.

## Rationale for Reclassification

Upon reviewing the content of the "Bottom-Up Construction Guide," several factors indicated it should be classified as a Principle (P) rather than a Rule (R):

1. **Conceptual Breadth**: The document establishes a comprehensive methodology for application construction, not just specific implementation details.

2. **Foundational Nature**: It defines a core approach that informs numerous implementation decisions, making it more fundamental than a specific rule.

3. **Abstract Application**: The principle can be applied across various contexts and implementations, with rules potentially deriving from it.

4. **Relationship to Other Principles**: It directly derives from core principles (P07) and influences other rules (R27), indicating its position in the principle hierarchy.

## Naming Convention Implementation

In accordance with MP02 (Structural Blueprint) and the domain naming recommendations, the following naming changes were made:

1. Changed classification prefix from "R16" to "P16"
2. Added domain prefix "app_" to indicate it applies specifically to application construction
3. Removed descriptive suffix "guide" since it's now classified as a principle rather than a rule
4. Updated title in YAML front matter to "App Bottom-Up Construction"

The final filename is: `P16_app_bottom_up_construction.md`

## Content Updates

The content was updated to better reflect its status as a principle:

1. Changed document title to "App Bottom-Up Construction Principle"
2. Added a clear "Core Concept" section at the beginning
3. Updated front matter to reflect it "derives_from" P07 rather than "implements" it
4. Added an "influences" field pointing to R27
5. Added a "Relationship to Other Principles" section
6. Added new "Implementation Guidelines" section
7. Improved the overall structure to better reflect a conceptual principle

## Impact

This reclassification enhances the clarity of our principle system by:

1. More accurately categorizing the document based on its actual content and role
2. Maintaining consistent naming across the system
3. Properly establishing the hierarchical relationships between principles
4. Following the domain-specific naming conventions established in MP02

## Related Changes

The following additional changes were made to maintain consistency:

1. Updated README.md to:
   - Add P16 to the Principles (P) list
   - Remove R16 from the Rules (R) list
   - Document the reclassification in the Recent Updates section
   
2. Updated any relationships in other principles that referenced R16 to now reference P16

## Conclusion

The reclassification of the Bottom-Up Construction principle from R16 to P16 improves the consistency and accuracy of our principle classification system. This change better reflects the conceptual nature of the content and its role in guiding implementation rather than prescribing specific implementation details.
