# DRV Files Renaming Complete Report

## Date: 2025-01-29

## Summary
Successfully renamed DRV files according to new DM_R042 rule to match internal P-numbers and @file directives.

## Principle Updates Completed

### New Rules Created:
- **DM_R042**: DRV Sequential Numbering Rule (English & Chinese)
  - Format: `{platform}_D{group}_{seq}.R`
  - Location: `00_principles/natural/en/part1_principles/CH02_data_management/rules/`

### Updated Principles:
- **MP064** (v2.0 → v2.1): Added DRV numbering requirements
- **DM_R028** (v2.0 → v2.1): Marked old DRV pattern as deprecated

## Files Renamed

### CBZ Platform (Based on P-numbers)
| Old Name | Internal Code | New Name | Status |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| cbz_DRV01_customer.R | #P07_D01_03 | cbz_D01_03.R | ✅ |
| cbz_DRV01_product.R | #P07_D01_04 | cbz_D01_04.R | ✅ |
| cbz_DRV01_sales.R | #P07_D01_05 | cbz_D01_05.R | ✅ |
| cbz_DRV01_metrics.R | #P07_D01_06 | cbz_D01_06.R | ✅ |

### AMZ Platform (Based on @file directives)
| Old Name | @file Directive | New Name | Status |
|----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| amz_DRV001_customer.R | amz_D01_03.R | amz_D01_03.R | ✅ |
| amz_DRV001_product.R | amz_D01_04.R | amz_D01_04.R | ✅ |
| amz_DRV001_sales.R | amz_D01_05.R | amz_D01_05.R | ✅ |
| amz_DRV001_metrics.R | amz_D01_06.R | amz_D01_06.R | ✅ |
| amz_DRV_summary.R | amz_S03_00.R | amz_S03_00.R | ✅ |

### Files Requiring Manual Review
These AMZ files don't have clear internal codes and need manual inspection:
- amz_DRV01_customer.R
- amz_DRV03_analysis_10.R
- amz_DRV03_analysis_11.R
- amz_DRV03_insights.R
- amz_DRV03_performance.R
- amz_DRV03_recommendations.R
- amz_DRV03_segments.R

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Execution Order**:
   - Files now sorted naturally by sequence: D01_03 → D01_04 → D01_05 → D01_06

2. **Internal-External Consistency**:
   - CBZ: External names match internal P-numbers
   - AMZ: External names match @file directives

3. **Simplified Orchestration**:
   ```r
   # Easy to run in sequence
   for (file in list.files("DRV/cbz", pattern = "D01_", full.names = TRUE)) {
     source(file)
   }
   ```

4. **Principle Compliance**:
   - ✅ DM_R042: Sequential numbering
   - ✅ MP064: ETL-DRV separation
   - ✅ DM_R041: Hierarchical directory structure

## Backup Location
- Backup created at: `backup_DRV_20250929/`

## Next Steps
1. Update orchestration scripts to use new filenames
2. Review remaining AMZ files that need renaming
3. Update any documentation that references old filenames
4. Test execution sequence with new naming

## Validation
Run this to verify correct sequence:
```r
# Check CBZ sequence
cbz_files <- list.files("DRV/cbz", pattern = "D01_\\d+\\.R", full.names = TRUE)
print(cbz_files)  # Should show D01_03, D01_04, D01_05, D01_06 in order

# Check AMZ sequence
amz_files <- list.files("DRV/amz", pattern = "D01_\\d+\\.R", full.names = TRUE)
print(amz_files)  # Should show D01_03, D01_04, D01_05, D01_06 in order
```
