## File Distribution

### ETL Scripts (24 files)
- **cbz platform**: 3 ETL scripts (0IM, 1ST, 2TR phases)
- **amz platform**: 16 ETL scripts (multiple data sources)
- **all platform**: 5 ETL scripts (cross-platform summaries)

### DRV Scripts (16 files)
- **cbz platform**: 4 derivation scripts (customer, product, sales, metrics)
- **amz platform**: 12 derivation scripts (various business logic)

### Orchestration Scripts (1 file)
- run_full_pipeline.R (main pipeline executor)

## Key Migrations Performed

### P01_D01 Series → cbz Platform
| Original | New Location | Type |
|----------|--------------|------|
| P01_D01_00.R | ETL/cbz/cbz_ETL01_0IM.R | Import |
| P01_D01_01.R | ETL/cbz/cbz_ETL01_1ST.R | Stage |
| P01_D01_02.R | ETL/cbz/cbz_ETL01_2TR.R | Transform |
| P01_D01_03.R | DRV/cbz/cbz_DRV01_customer.R | Derivation |
| P01_D01_04.R | DRV/cbz/cbz_DRV01_product.R | Derivation |
| P01_D01_05.R | DRV/cbz/cbz_DRV01_sales.R | Derivation |
| P01_D01_06.R | DRV/cbz/cbz_DRV01_metrics.R | Derivation |

### S01 Series → Cross-platform Summaries
| Original | New Location | Type |
|----------|--------------|------|
| S01_00.R | ETL/all/all_ETL_summary_0IM.R | Import |
| S01_01.R | ETL/all/all_ETL_summary_1ST.R | Stage |

### Amazon Files
- **Already compliant**: amz_ETL03-07 series (10 files)
- **Standardized**: amz_D01 series → amz_ETL001/amz_DRV001
- **Reorganized**: amz_D03 series → amz_DRV03 derivations

## Compliance Status

✅ **MP029**: No fake data created - all operations used real files only
✅ **MP064**: ETL-Derivation separation achieved - clear directory boundaries
✅ **MP104**: Clear data flow phases - 0IM → 1ST → 2TR pipeline
✅ **DM_R028**: Standardized naming convention - {platform}_ETL/DRV_{id}_{phase/type}.R
✅ **R113**: Four-part structure maintained in migration script

## Files Not Migrated (Kept in Root)

These files were intentionally kept in the root directory as they are not ETL/DRV scripts:

1. **Application files**: app.R, app_modified.R
2. **Test files**: 7000_0_7_0_test_app_functionality.R, test_customer_dna_implementation.R
3. **Check scripts**: check_db_status.R, check_imported_data.R, simple_check.R
4. **Implementation files**: implement_customer_dna*.R, basic_customer_dna.R, simplified_customer_dna.R
5. **Documentation**: *.md files
6. **Migration script**: migrate_to_hierarchical_structure.R

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Review migrated files in new locations
2. ⏳ Test orchestration scripts to ensure pipeline works
3. ⏳ Update any hardcoded paths in application files

### Short-term Actions
1. Create platform-specific pipeline runners (cbz, amz, eby)
2. Add error handling to orchestration scripts
3. Document new structure in main README

### Long-term Actions
1. Standardize remaining file naming (amz_ETL001 → amz_ETL01)
2. Add eby platform scripts when available
3. Create monitoring dashboard for pipeline execution

## Backup Information

All original files have been backed up to: `backup_20250928_212213/`

**Important**: Keep this backup until you have verified that all scripts work correctly in their new locations.

## Usage Examples

### Run Full Pipeline
```bash
cd orchestration
Rscript run_full_pipeline.R
```

### Run Platform-Specific ETL
```bash
# Amazon ETL only
cd ETL/amz
for file in *_0IM.R; do Rscript "$file"; done
for file in *_1ST.R; do Rscript "$file"; done
for file in *_2TR.R; do Rscript "$file"; done

# CBZ derivations only
cd DRV/cbz
for file in *.R; do Rscript "$file"; done
```

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Backup created successfully
- [x] Directory structure created (ETL/, DRV/, orchestration/)
- [x] Files migrated to correct locations
- [x] Naming conventions standardized
- [x] Orchestration script created
- [ ] Pipeline execution tested
- [ ] Application paths updated
- [ ] Team notified of changes

## Summary

The migration to hierarchical structure has been completed successfully. The new organization provides:

1. **Clear separation** between ETL (data movement) and DRV (business logic)
2. **Platform-specific organization** for easier maintenance
3. **Standardized naming** following DM_R028 convention
4. **Pipeline orchestration** for automated execution
5. **Full compliance** with MAMBA principles (MP029, MP064, MP104)

This restructuring improves code maintainability, enables better collaboration, and provides a scalable foundation for future growth.
